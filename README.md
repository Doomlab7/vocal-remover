# File Watcher Workflow

The FastAPI App is dead, using pinchflat to download now to disk and a watcher app in this repo, spun up as a compose stack, to just monitor the folder and persorm the instrumental split and upload to Under Review folder in nextcloud

# Vocal Remover + App

I've added some scripts that make my usage of this tool easier - they are used in combination with the `Justfile`

Also there's `app.py` which is a FastAPI app + tailwind front end that allows someone to drop a youtube link, and get the song downloaded with vocals split uploaded to a nextcloud instnace over WebDAV

This is a deep-learning-based tool to extract instrumental track from your songs.

## Installation

### Getting vocal-remover
Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/tsurumeso/vocal-remover/releases).

### Install PyTorch
**See**: [GET STARTED](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

### Install the other packages
```
cd vocal-remover
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The following command separates the input into instrumental and vocal tracks. They are saved as `*_Instruments.wav` and `*_Vocals.wav`.

### Run on CPU
```
python inference.py --input path/to/an/audio/file
```

### Run on GPU
```
python inference.py --input path/to/an/audio/file --gpu 0
```

### Advanced options
`--tta` option performs Test-Time-Augmentation to improve the separation quality.
```
python inference.py --input path/to/an/audio/file --tta --gpu 0
```

`--postprocess` option masks instrumental part based on the vocals volume to improve the separation quality.  
**Experimental Warning**: If you get any problems with this option, please disable it.
```
python inference.py --input path/to/an/audio/file --postprocess --gpu 0
```

## Train your own model

### Place your dataset
```
path/to/dataset/
  +- instruments/
  |    +- 01_foo_inst.wav
  |    +- 02_bar_inst.mp3
  |    +- ...
  +- mixtures/
       +- 01_foo_mix.wav
       +- 02_bar_mix.mp3
       +- ...
```

### Train a model
```
python train.py --dataset path/to/dataset --reduction_rate 0.5 --mixup_rate 0.5 --gpu 0
```
